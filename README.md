# VIM Setting
Primarily forked from [https://github.com/amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

I currently use the `vimrcs/basic.vim` with neovim (see comments at the bottom of that file).

The `.vimrc` file is as follows to enable config `basic.vim`.

```
set runtimepath+=~/.vim_runtime
source ~/.vim_runtime/vimrcs/basic.vim
```
